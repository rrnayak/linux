Qualcomm Technologies Inc. GENI Serial Engine based UART Controller

The Generic Interface (GENI) Serial Engine based UART controller supports
console use-cases and is supported only by GENI based Qualcomm Universal
Peripheral (QUP) cores.

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain "qcom,geni-debug-uart".
- reg: Should contain UART register location and length.
- reg-names: Should contain "se-phys".
- interrupts: Should contain UART core interrupts.
- clock-names: Should contain "se-clk".
- clocks: clocks needed for UART, includes the core clock.
- pinctrl-names/pinctrl-0/1: The GPIOs assigned to this core. The names
  Should be "active" and "sleep" for the pin confuguration when core is active
  or when entering sleep state.

Example:
uart0: qcom,serial@a88000 {
	compatible = "qcom,geni-debug-uart";
	reg = <0xa88000 0x7000>;
	reg-names = "se-phys";
	interrupts = <0 355 0>;
	clock-names = "se-clk";
	clocks = <&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP0_S0_CLK>;
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&qup_1_uart_3_active>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&qup_1_uart_3_sleep>;
};
