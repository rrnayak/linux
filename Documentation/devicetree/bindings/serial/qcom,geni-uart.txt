Qualcomm Technologies Inc. GENI based Serial UART Controller driver

This serial UART driver supports console use-cases. This driver is meant
only for Generic Interface (GENI) based Qualcomm Universal Peripheral (QUP)
cores and isn't backwards compatible.

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain "qcom,geni-uart, qcom,geni-console"
- reg: Should contain UART register location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain UART core interrupts.
- clocks: clocks needed for UART, includes the core and AHB clock.
- pinctrl-names/pinctrl-0/1: The GPIOs assigned to this core. The names
  Should be "active" and "sleep" for the pin confuguration when core is active
  or when entering sleep state.
- qcom,wrapper-core: Wrapper QUP core containing this UART controller.

Example:
qup_uart11: qcom,qup_uart@0xa88000 {
	compatible = "qcom,geni-uart";
	reg = <0xa88000 0x7000>;
	reg-names = "se_phys";
	clock-names = "se-clk", "m-ahb", "s-ahb";
	clocks = <&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP0_S0_CLK>,
		<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_M_AHB_CLK>,
		<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_S_AHB_CLK>;
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&qup_1_uart_3_active>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&qup_1_uart_3_sleep>;
	interrupts = <0 355 0>;
	qcom,wrapper-core = <&qup_0>;
};
