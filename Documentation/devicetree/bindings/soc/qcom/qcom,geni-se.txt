Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. GENI Serial Engine QUP Wrapper Controller

Generic Interface (GENI) based Qualcomm Universal Peripheral (QUP) wrapper
is a programmable module for supporting a wide range of serial interfaces
like UART, SPI, I2C, I3C, etc. A single QUP module can provide upto 8 Serial
Interfaces, using its internal Serial Engines. The GENI Serial Engine QUP
Wrapper controller is modeled as a node with zero or more child nodes each
representing a serial engine.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,geni-se-qup".
- reg:			Must contain QUP register address and length.
- clock-names:		Must contain "m-ahb" and "s-ahb".
- clocks:		AHB clocks needed by the device.

Required properties if child node exists:
- #address-cells: Must be 1
- #size-cells: Must be 1
- ranges: Must be present

Properties for children:

A GENI based QUP wrapper controller node can contain 0 or more child nodes
representing serial devices.  These serial devices can be a QCOM UART, I2C
controller, spi controller, or some combination of aforementioned devices.

Example:
	qup0: qcom,geniqup0@8c0000 {
		compatible = "qcom,geni-se-qup";
		reg = <0x8c0000 0x6000>;
		clock-names = "m-ahb", "s-ahb";
		clocks = <&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_M_AHB_CLK>,
			<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_S_AHB_CLK>;
	}
