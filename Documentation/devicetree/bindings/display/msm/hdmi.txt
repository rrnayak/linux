- hdmi-mux-supply: phandle to mux regulator
- qcom,dsi-phy: phandle to HDMI PHY device node

Optional properties:
- qcom,hdmi-tx-mux-en-gpio: hdmi mux enable pin
- qcom,hdmi-tx-mux-sel-gpio: hdmi mux select pin
- power-domains: reference to the power domain(s), if available.
- pinctrl-names: the pin control state names; should contain "default"
- pinctrl-0: the default pinctrl state (active)
- pinctrl-1: the "sleep" pinctrl state

HDMI PHY:
Required properties:
- compatible: Could be the following
  * "qcom,hdmi-phy-8x60"
  * "qcom,hdmi-phy-8960"
  * "qcom,hdmi-phy-8x74"
  * "qcom,hdmi-phy-8996"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers of the PHY sub blocks.
- reg-names: The names of register regions. The following regions are required:
  * "hdmi_pll"
  * "hdmi_phy"
  For HDMI PHY on msm8996, these additional register regions are required:
    * "hdmi_tx_l0"
    * "hdmi_tx_l1"
    * "hdmi_tx_l3"
    * "hdmi_tx_l4"
- power-domains: Should be <&mmcc MDSS_GDSC>.
- clocks: device clocks
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- core-vdda-supply: phandle to vdda regulator device node
